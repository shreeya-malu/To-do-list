# 📝 TaskTrackr — A GraphQL To-Do App with Daily Scoring

Welcome to **TaskTrackr**, my very first **full-stack** application!  
Built with a focus on learning modern development practices, this app helps users manage their daily tasks, prioritize them, and get rewarded with coins as they complete them.

## 📚 What I Learned

This project was a huge learning leap for me!  
Aside from HTML/CSS/JS which I was familiar with, I got hands-on with:

- 🧠 **GraphQL:** Learned to structure queries and mutations
- 🌐 **Apollo Server:** Understood resolvers, schema design, and how servers communicate
- 🚀 **Render Deployment:** Faced and resolved deployment issues (switched from Apollo Studio to Render for public availability)
- 🧩 Backend setup: Schema definitions, server logic, and integrating everything smoothly with frontend

There were moments of confusion and many small bugs — but debugging, Googling, and pushing through taught me more than any tutorial could. 💪

## 💭 What's Next?

I’d love to keep improving this!  
If you have any feature ideas or feedback, feel free to open an issue or drop me a message. Always open to learning more. :)

## 📁 Setup Locally (Optional)

If you'd like to run the app locally:
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the backend folder and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   node index.js
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser

## 📎 Note

The backend is no longer hosted on Render, so this is currently a **static-only repo with demo recording**.
